<h3>Ingredients</h3>
 <ol>
    <li><strong>Meat</strong></li>
    <p>this lasagna recipe starts with a pound of ground meat (½ pound ground pork, ½ pound lean ground beef).</p>
    <li><strong>Onion</strong></li>
   <p> A diced onion is cooked until translucent with the ground meat.</p>
   <li><strong>Canned tomatoes</strong></li>
   <p>You'll need a can of tomato sauce and a can of crushed tomatoes.</p>
   <li><strong>Fresh herbs</strong></li>
   <p>For fresh flavor, chop two tablespoons of parsley and crush one clove of garlic.</p>
   <li><strong>Sugar</strong></li>
   <p> A dash of sugar balances out all of the acidity from the tomatoes.</p>
   <li><strong>Spices and Seasonings</strong></li>
   <p>This homemade lasagna is seasoned with dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper</p>
   <li><strong>Noodles</strong></li>
   <p>Of course, you'll need lasagna noodles! This recipe calls for uncooked noodles, but you can use the oven-ready variety to save time.</p>
   <li><strong>Cheese</strong></li>
   <p>The cheese layer is made up of cottage cheese and Parmesan. You'll also need shredded mozzarella.</p>
   <li><strong>Eggs</strong></li>
   <p>Eggs make the cheese layer extra creamy. Plus, they act as a binding agent (which means they hold the layer together).</p>
